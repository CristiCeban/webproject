# webproject
This is a L2 final project for Web development on UPEC.
It's a web app using php for server-side. It is not finished .The remained around 30% of work to do.
It's a site which allows to view Stats of the courses/teachers/
groups and also to manage them(for administrator (CRUD)).
I used XAMPP to deploy project. You can use any php server you like.
I also I used DB for phpMyAdmin . 

To test the project.

- Deploy project on XAMPP(or what you like);

- Deploy DB to phpMyAdmin(or what you like);

- configure the "config/db_config.php" with your actual ServerName,username,pass...

- Open "client/index.php".

To test all the features you need an account.You can create your own for statistics purpose.

For Admin's purpose you can use some of the existent ones as:

- username-"admin1" (without quotes);
- password -"admin" (without quotes);
